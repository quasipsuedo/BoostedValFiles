# BoostedValFiles

1. Install r2modman (google r2modman). IT is a mod loader

2. Open r2modman, select Valheim and enter a profile. This will make a new instance of the game, not effecting your vanilla or other modded clients.

3. Go to online section of r2modman and install Bepinex for Valheim (the first mod)

3. Once that's done, click settings on the left bar, then the second option 'Browse Profile Folder'

4. This will bring you to the Valheim instance you just installed. Open Bepinex, and place all the files in this repo in their respective folders.

5. Go back to r2modman and hit Play Modded! The server IP and PASS will load automatically.
